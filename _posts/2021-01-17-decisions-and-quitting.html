<p>If you are struggling in deciding between two choices:</p>

<ul>
    <li> <u>Decision Rule Version 1 (less extreme)</u>: Choose any one of them. The variance around either outcome is
                   generally
        larger
        than the margins of your pros and cons (by definition - you are struggling to choose). It is best to choose a
        path than stagnate.

    <li><u>Decision Rule Version 2 (more extreme)</u>: Choose the one that takes you furthest away from your current
    state.
        Some
        <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/618462">empirical studies</a> support this. Also assumes
        there is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost">sunk cost</a> and <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect">endowment bias</a> on average and
        hence status quo is being overweighted.
</ul>
<p>For decisions in general, it is very important that you are able to live with the outcomes, regret and doubt are not
    healthy. There are tactics you can employ to assist you. As <a href="https://tim.blog/">Tim Ferriss</a> describes
    his interpretation of
    Schwartz's <a
            href="https://www.amazon.com/Paradox-Choice-More-Less-Revised/dp/0062449923/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=">The
        Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less </a> - the more options you consider, the more buyer's regret
    you'll have; the more options you encounter, the less fulfilling your ultimate outcome will be.</p>
