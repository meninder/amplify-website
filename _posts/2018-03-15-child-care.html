<p>Continuing my exploration of graphing and maps, I went to NJ.gov to find publicly available data to play with.
    The first dataset I cam across was on Licensed Child Care Centers, which fortunately for society, is a public
    safety mechanism that creates requirements for all child care centers and requires their premise to get
    inspection certificates, which are available online. In addition, there are statistics on each center’s location,
    capacity, and min/max age. This lead me to wonder: if I were to open a business, I’d prefer to choose a place that
    is underserved (ignoring <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotelling%27s_law">Hotelling's
        law</a>, I am not an economics major, but maybe this business domain is an exception to the law). </p>


<p>The US Census Bureau has 2017 estimates for each county’s population for children under 5. I calculated two metrics
    for each county:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Addressable Market</b>: using this term very informally, I defined it as the number of children under 5 in
        the
        county minus the county’s capacity to cater to under 5.
    </li>
    <li><b>Ratio </b> of children under 5 to child center capacity.</li>
</ul>

<p> Figure 1 and 2 show the same data, but in different formats. The latter is simply a map; there isn’t additional
    information, but I thought it was a cool way to show data. </p>

<p> The left side of Figure 1 shows that Ocean, Middlesex, and Essex have 20-30k children that wouldn’t have a care
    center spot in their county if each operated at capacity (and they were looking of course). Warren, Salem, and
    Hunterdon have a smaller issue by population size. While this metric provides an idea of how many children
    cannot be served, it doesn’t give any insight on opportunity because the counties on the left side are ordered
    roughly in proportion to their population. </p>

<p>The ratio of children under 5 to capacity gives a normalized view. On average, counties have a ratio of 35 children
    to 1 child care center spot. In other words, 3% of children under 5 use child care centers. The right hand
    side of Figure 1 shows 6 counties with a ratio of 40:1. These include: <i>Cape May, Salem, Sussex, Ocean, Atlantic,
        and Warren. </i></p>

<p>One note on Figure 2: the first metric (left side) shows the darker regions along the coast, which reflects the
    point above that this metric is proportional to population density (which is higher near the coast). Using the
    normalized metric, the colors become a little more random (right side). The area close to NYC shows lower
    ratios, perhaps driven by higher demand for child care services by people that commute to NYC. </p>

<p>There are several factors that determine child care center businesses. If I were really going to look into business
    opportunities, I would want to cut the data with socio-economic attributes.</p>
