<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The serverless components of the <a href="https://www.serverlessexperiments.com/entity_resolution.html"> Pun
    Generator Application</a> are described in <a
        href="{% link _posts/2022-01-03-serverless-experiments.html %}">another post</a>.  For more detail the
    subject of Entity Resolution, I wrote
        <a href="{% link _posts/2021-09-12-entity-resolution-primer.html %}" class="link-primary">this primer</a>
    for my NYU class. For the specific implementation, the methodology is described below.</p>

<h2 id="methodology-i">Methodology I</h2>

    <p> The model is based on <a href="https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html" class="link-primary">Norvig's
        spelling corrector</a>.
        The general equation, using Bayes Theorem to disambiguate sub-problems:
        $$\{c|P(c|\epsilon)>\theta\}\longrightarrow \{c|P(\epsilon|c)P(c)>\theta\}$$
    </p>
    <p> There are four parts:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Selection Model:</b> $>\theta$. This is the threshold by which two entities are considered a
            match. This should be based on
            some training examples of labeled data.
        </li>
        <li><b>Candidate Model:</b> $\{c\}$. Set of candidates. Picking an appropriate set of candidates is the
            crux
            of the entity resolution methodology. Too few candidates will result in low recall. Too many will
            lead
            to $n^2$ computations making it infeasible. In my current approach, I am only considering two
            candidates
            that are inputted by the users.
        </li>
        <li><b>Error Model:</b> $P(\epsilon|c)$. There are numerous methods to model this. For example, a
            machine
            learning model. In this case, the model is number of correct divided by length of bigger word. An
            imperfect measure to say the least.
        </li>
        <li><b>Entity Model:</b> $P(c)$. Assumed to be 1 for now. When properly implemented, will correct for
            common/rare
            instances.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The algorithm does basic treatment to the two input words (lower case, removing punctuation and words like
        inc, corp, etc.  Then the model described above is applied to calculate the probabilty of the match.  Entity
        Resolution is a complex, deep topic.  This application barely scratches the surface.  </p>
