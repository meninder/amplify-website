<p>Despite winning all season, your baseball team can disappoint in the playoffs. The Oakland Athletics played 162 games
    and won 60% of them, then lose the 1 game wildcard playoff (again!). All probable outcomes suffer from statistical
    significance. If you are 60% sure your trade will be a success, that is a phenomenal edge. However, if you make a
    single bet, then 4 times out of 10, you will lose. And remember, you only care about the outcome realized, like the
    Athletics going home, all that matters is what happened. Life has a statistical sample size of 1.</p>

<p>Then, how do you capitalize on your edge? Make more bets, play more games. In a 7 game series, the Athletics win 7
    times out of 10. If you place 41 trades, then 90% of the time you make moe money than lose 90%. </p>
