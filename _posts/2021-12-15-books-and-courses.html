            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/">Python Data Science Handbook</a> by
                    Jake VanderPlas
                </li>
                <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1491962291">Hands-On
                    Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow</a> by Aurélien Géron
                </li>
                <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython-ebook/dp/B075X4LT6K">Python
                    for Data Analysis</a> by Wes McKinney

            <h3>Courses (Programming)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I generally recommend being as hands-on as possible.</li>
                <li>Everyone learns differently. Talk to someone <em>like</em> you in experience, learning style,
                    domain, etc. to find out what they did or do to learn. I learned Python a decade ago and had some
                    previous coding experience, so my information might not be as relevant.
                </li>
                <li>If you need video instruction &amp; have specific needs, start with YouTube to answer your specific
                    questions.
                </li>
                <li>If you need video instruction &amp; prefer a course to maintain accountability and set a learning
                    path, then try all free options first, including Coursera. For example, <a
                            href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python">Python for Everybody
                        Specialization</a>, which I have not taken.
                </li>
                <li>If you are ok with text instruction, many new tools include built-in editors that code as you go.
                    For example, Kaggle is a great resource: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python">Learn Python
                        Tutorials</a>.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="courses-ml-div">
            <h3>Courses (Machine Learning & AI)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Know your objective and search accordingly. Some examples include: business impact, technical
                    implementation of algorithms, technical implementation of deployment, hands-on data analysis,
                    general survey of AI, Deep Learning, NLP, understanding the difference between different techniques,
                    etc.
                </li>
                <li>Know your technical background and search accordingly. If you are weak or don’t know how to program,
                    then certain courses will challenge your programming abilities and detract from learning ML, which
                    is ok as long as you are aware. If you don’t have a Linear Algebra or optimization background, then
                    certain courses will challenge your mathematical background.
                </li>
                <li>Know that there is a lot of content out there, so do some work upfront before you invest your time.
                    (See above notes).
                </li>
                <li>An example of a clear explainer is Andrew Ng. This <a
                        href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">course</a> is a bit outdated (not many
                    people use Octave or Matlab), but this seems to be a new <a
                            href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone">course</a> (I did not take) and here
                    is his newsletter.
                </li>
                <li><a href="https://www.fast.ai">fast.ai</a> is another great resource skewed to more technical users
                    and deep learning.
                </li>
                <li>There are <em>many, many</em> other resources.</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/dair-ai/ML-YouTube-Courses">Here </a>is a very nice curated list.</li>
            </ul>
