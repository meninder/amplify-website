<p>
    Usual great <a href="https://xkcd.com/2480/">XKCD</a> comic from Monroe. Posting some <a
        href="https://github.com/meninder/JupyterNotebooks/blob/main/xkcd2480.ipynb">code</a> to replicate
    identification
    and plotting of cities that have names for which people immediately think of the more popular one. For example:
    Austin, Minnesota, not Austin, Texas.
