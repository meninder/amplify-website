    fame is a personal hero of mine – who wouldn’t dream of a life of articulating witty,
    physics humor in the form of comics? Unfortunately, the market leaves room for very few to occupy the space. It also
    requires one to have witty, physics humor they can articulate in the form of comics.

    a huge following and you still have to come up with the material yourself.
