<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>As AI matures, more and more of its pipeline is becoming commoditized. Cloud services have made model deployment
    close to seamless. In this post, I present a step-by-step tutorial on deploying a ML model on Google Cloud Platform
    (GCP) by remixing a few well-documented components: Flask, Google App Engine (GAE), Google Cloud Storage, sklearn &
    AI Platform.
</p>

<p>Just a few years ago, training model artifacts was new and exciting. Now, open source packages (Tensorflow, sklearn,
    etc) have made it accessible in just a few lines of code. In the same way, cloud services (GCP, Azure, AWS) make the
    deployment of models more straightforward than ever so we can move up the food chain onto the more challenging
    horizons: interpretability, adoption, A/B testing and more.

        <a href="https://pythonbasics.org/what-is-flask-python/">micro-framework</a>
        application that serves up some text locally, then deployed on the cloud. In this part, we set up a GCP project
        following Google's documentation. The output is a simple set of static text display.

            href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html">
        RandomForestRegressor</a> model on a simple data set. The model artifact is
        then uploaded to Google Cloud Storage. A model is deployed on Google Cloud's AI Platform and locally called for
        predictions.

    <li><a href="{% link _posts/2021-08-30-deploy-an-ml-model-on-gcp-3.html %}">Part III</a> puts it all together.
        The web application from Part I is modified to take features as an input  and then calls AI Platform to make
        a prediction and display it.
