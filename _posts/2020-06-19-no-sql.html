<p>In most of my experience as a Data Science at a large Bank, I have retrieved data from relational databases. More
    recently, we have built a new platform, where I have been working with Cassandra for timeseries on a Kubernetes
    cluster. I happened to watch this 1-hour <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qI_g07C_Q5I">presentation </a>
    on NoSQL databases, which furthered my motivation to understand the topic, so I read a <a
            href="https://www.amazon.com/NoSQL-Distilled-Emerging-Polyglot-Persistence/dp/0321826620/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=nosql&qid=1592230765&sr=8-2">textbook</a>
    on NoSQL by Pramod Sadalage and Martin Fowler. Below are my notes.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Polyglot Persistence is the idea of using different data stores in different circumstances. The term borrows
        from
        the term Polyglot Programming referring to multiple computer programming languages within an application.

    <li>NoSQL is a movement, not a technology.

    <li>Relational databases are not designed to run on clusters and thus scaling presents a challenge. Amazon (Dynamo
        paper) and Google (BigTable paper) were very influential in setting the direction for the resolution.

    <li>Relational databases often work very well. Migrating away from this framework should be motivated by a specific
        objective (e.g. running on clusters).

    <li>Integration databases are a single source of data for multiple applications. The alternative paradigm is an
        Application database, which has a one to one relationship between storage and application.

    <li>Application databases are the paradigm of NoSQL. The application “knows” the database structure. A schemaless db
        shifts the schema into the application that accesses it. This type of db is more forgiving for evolving needs.

    <li>Relational databases are good for analyzing data. NoSQL databases are not flexible for querying.

    <li>There are 4 types of NoSQL dbs, the first 3 are called aggregate oriented data models.
        <ul>
            <li>Key-Value: Redis, Riak, Dynamo; value is opaque

            <li>Document: MongoDB, Couch; value has structure.

            <li>Column-family: Cassandra, HBase

            <li>Graph: NodeJs
        </ul>
    <li>An aggregate is a collection of related objects that are treated as an object. They form the boundaries of an
        ACID operation. It is central to running on a cluster.

    <li>Distribution Model. Demonstrates the trade-off between consistency and availability.
        <ul>
            <li>Single-server

            <li>Sharding: different parts of data onto different servers. Each server is a single source of a subset of
                data.

            <li>Master/slave replication: Replicating data across multiple nodes with one node the authority (master).
                Helps read scalability.

            <li>Peer-to-peer replication: Replicating data across all nodes, no authority. Helps write scalability.
                Linear scaling because no master (Cassandra is example).
        </ul>
    <li>Consistency:
        <ul>
            <li>Conflicts occur when clients try to write the same data at the same time (write-write) or one client
                reads inconsistent data during another’s write (read-write).

            <li>Pessimistic approach lock data to prevent conflicts, optimistic detects conflicts and fixes.

            <li>To get good consistency, many nodes should be involved but the reduces latency.

            <li>CAP Theorem: when you create partitions, you trade-off consistency with availability.
        </ul>
</ul>
