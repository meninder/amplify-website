        Letter to Shareholders</a> that are obvious after reading , but require
    continual reminding... we need to remind ourselves. Full excerpt below. He defines the irreversible Type 1 decision
    and the changeable Type 2 decisions. Applying the heavy-weight Type 1 decision-making process to Type 2 decisions
    grinds your workflow to halt.</p>

<p>Excerpt from the letter:</p>
<p><i>Some decisions are consequential and irreversible or nearly irreversible – one-way doors – and these decisions
    must
    be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation. If you walk through and don’t
    like what you see on the other side, you can’t get back to where you were before. We can call these Type 1
    decisions. But most decisions aren’t like that – they are changeable, reversible – they’re two-way doors. If you’ve
    made a suboptimal Type 2 decision, you don’t have to live with the consequences for that long. You can reopen the
    door and go back through. Type 2 decisions can and should be made quickly by high judgment individuals or small
    groups. </i></p>
<p><i>As organizations get larger, there seems to be a tendency to use the heavy-weight Type 1 decision-making
    process on
    most decisions, including many Type 2 decisions. The end result of this is slowness, unthoughtful risk aversion,
    failure to experiment sufficiently, and consequently diminished invention.1 We’ll have to figure out how to fight
    that tendency.</i></p>
<p><i>And one-size-fits-all thinking will turn out to be only one of the pitfalls. We’ll work hard to avoid it… and any
    other large organization maladies we can identify.</i></p>
