    I'm a Met fan, which creates an asymmetric skew in memory: the bad seems to stand out more than the good. As of
    6/8/2021, they are in first place and I wanted to know, when was the last time this happened? More generically, for
    a given date, when was the last time they were in first? <a

    leverages <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/">baseball-reference.com</a> to
                                                                find the
    last time the Mets were in first place by date.
