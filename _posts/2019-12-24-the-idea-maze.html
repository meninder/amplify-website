<p> I came across a great <a href="https://cdixon.org/2013/08/04/the-idea-maze">blog post</a> on the idea maze, based
    on a <a
            href="https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/startup/lecture_slides/lecture5-market-wireframing-design.pdf">lecture</a>
    by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/balajissrinivasan/">Balaji Srinivasan</a>. I read it
    through
    the
    lens an employee at a large bank and aspiring “intra-preneur”. </p>

<p>It points out that it is relatively straightforward to have an idea, to identify the point of entry to a complex
    maze. The heavy lifting is to think through and develop deep, unique insight into all possible paths from idea to
    profit.</p>

<p>In order to generate this bird’s eye view, four sources of inspiration are highlighted. Each source has a distinct
    representation inside a large bank.</p>

<ol>
    <li><u>Past history</u>: Identify similar ideas that have been tried before. It is the beauty and often discouraging
        fact
        that
        most ideas have been tried, but died on a vine for various reasons (eg political, technological, or
        organizational constraints). Finding out requires some connection to senior people who have been around. Sharing
        your idea and not operating in stealth mode has benefits that compensate for the small risk of having the idea
        stolen.

    <li><u>Analogy</u>: Identify other businesses within a large bank where the idea has been tried, perhaps in a
        different
        format with adaptations for that business’s nuances. Like buying an old home, a little imagination is required
        to see how it applies - if it was obvious, there isn’t much value in your contribution.

    <li><u>Theories</u>: Connect with your local academic institutions to find scholars on the problem. By offering
        adjustments to the assumptions in their publications to account for business specifics, this source may provide
        deep insight.

    <li><u>Direct experience</u>: Put yourself in the maze and be aware that you are in one.
