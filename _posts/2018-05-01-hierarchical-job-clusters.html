<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Last week, I gave a guest lecture at NYU School of Engineering last week to Financial Engineering students on a Data
    Science topic. The lecture covered Unsupervised Learning techniques: PCA, K-means and Hierarchical clustering. I
    started the lecture by discussing the breadth of potential career paths in Finance. On the train ride home after the
    lecture, it occurred to me that I could use a clustering algorithm to build a map of the roles within a Bank. I
    think this would be helpful to anyone because there are universes amongst universes inside these large Banks; only
    select gray haired veterans have a true understanding of. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could draw a diagram showing
    that? </p>
<h2>The Data </h2>
<p>The most obtainable data on jobs that I could think of are the descriptions themselves. The goal would be to
    related the descriptions, a natural language processing (NLP) problem. However, the first issue getting the job
    descriptions to create a first pass/proof of concept. Using <a href="http://monster.com/">monster.com’s</a> “rss”
    feed, I was able to get
    about
    15 descriptions for 4 separate job searches: 'financial analyst', 'accounting manager', 'web developer',
    'pharmaceutical sales'). </p>


<h2>The Code</h2>
<p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is notoriously difficult and I have never used any of the Python NLTK libraries
    to solve a problem. Fortunately, bloggers have posted prototype proof of concepts. In particular, <a
            href="http://brandonrose.org/clustering"> this </a>
    approach for clustering movie descriptions was highly translatable to job description clustering. Briefly,
    after vectorizing the job description, a distance was calculated between vectors. Then the vectors were
    clustered using Ward’s linkage function.</p>

<p>Much more work is required to take this seriously. Specifically: 1) more data 2) optimize vectorization thresholds
    3) scrub/vet data appropriately 4) pick a good distance measure.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the diagram below, the horizontal length of the legs joining two nodes is proportional to their dissimilarity:
    nodes joined by short legs are highly related. Of the 4 job descriptions, web developer stands alone and tends to
    have job descriptions highly related to each other. Pharmaceutical sales is also well clustered, although can be
    found closely linked to accounting managers in some cases. Financial analyst, a very vague title, tends to be
    sprinkled in. </p>
