<p>I was going to write an article about how resilience can be a bad thing, but found this <a
        href="https://hbr.org/2017/08/the-dark-side-of-resilience">article </a> by HBR
    captures my sentiment. In summary:</p>

<p>"...too much resilience could make people overly tolerant of adversity. At work, this can translate into putting up
    with boring or demoralizing jobs — and particularly bad bosses — for longer than needed."</p>
