<p>I recently moved to a house that uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heating_oil">heating oil</a>. The tank
    has a wireless sensor that transmits the number
    of gallons remaining in the tank via the provider's website. I was interested in estimating how many gallons of oil
    we use based on the temperature outside. This requires two steps: record the daily value of gallons remaining in the
    tank and regress it against the temperature outside.</p>

<ol>
    <li><u>Scraping your data</u>: The code on this <a href="https://github.com/meninder/HomeHeatingOil">Github page</a>
        shows how to use the Python <a href="https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/">selenium</a> package to
        log into
        your account, access the appropriate page and extract the field called gallons. A daily <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">cron</a> job runs
        the code, see <a
                href="https://ole.michelsen.dk/blog/schedule-jobs-with-crontab-on-mac-osx/">this</a> for creating a
        job
        on a Mac.
    </li>
    <li><u>Linear Regression</u>: External temperature is pulled from this site as a csv. A linear relationship is
        estimated using the daily gallons and temperature recorded. In other words, daily gallons used = daily gallons
        used at 0 deg F + temperature x daily gallons used per degree. This is estimated using sklearn and the constants
        are: daily gallons used at 0F is ~20 gallons and gallons used per degree = -0.2 gallons per degree. In other
        words, if it is 30F outside, we expect to use about 15 gallons.
    </li>
    <li><u>K-factor and degree days</u>: You can also calculate a home's <a
            href="https://www.griffithenergyservices.com/articles/degree-days-and-the-k-factor">k-factor</a>, a measure
        of efficiency. This number is
        most useful when comparing numbers to other homes, like your neighborhood. Roughly, you take the sum of degree
        days and divide it by the total gallons you use. Degree days just 65 - average temperature fo that day. So,
        using 15 gallons on a day that is 30 degrees is a k-factor of about 2, which is extremely inefficient. While it
        depends on square footage, new houses can be on the order of 6.
