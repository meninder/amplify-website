<h2 id="the-application">The Application</h2>
<p>I recently built <a href="https://www.serverlessexperiments.com/index">this application</a> using serverless
    architecture</a>, which is described in more detail here. There are two running experiments:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pun Generator Application <a href="https://www.serverlessexperiments.com/pun_generator">here</a>,
            methodology described <a href="{% link _posts/2022-01-04-pun-generator.html %}">here</a>.</li>
        <li>Entity Resolution Application <a href="https://www.serverlessexperiments.com/entity_resolution">here</a>,
            methodology described <a href="{% link _posts/2022-01-13-entity-resolution.html %}">here</a>.</li>
    </ul>

<h2 id="what-is-serverless">What is Serverless?</h2>
<p> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/serverless-architectures-learn-more/">AWS explains</a> the term
    <em>serverless</em>, aka Function as a Service (FaaS) as:
<blockquote>
    <p>A serverless architecture is a way to build and run applications and services without having to manage
        infrastructure... You no
        longer have to provision, scale, and maintain servers to run your applications, databases, and storage systems.
    </p>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>The figure below summarizes a generic serverless architecture with AWS.  S3 and Dynamo are stateful components
    for storage that may or may not be needed in all application.  <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">Lambda</a> is
        the serverless, event-driven compute.  Instead of spinning up a machine that is latent most of the time, this
    is on demand compute.  Hence, for a few pennies a month (actually free!), I can have the live application
    running.  Amplify is the front end for these applications.
